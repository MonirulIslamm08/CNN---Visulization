ðŸ§  CNN Visualization 
A project focused on visualizing and interpreting the inner workings of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using various techniques such as filter visualization, feature maps, and Grad-CAM.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Visualize filters/kernels from convolutional layers

Generate feature maps for input images

Grad-CAM heatmaps for understanding model predictions

Support for custom and pre-trained CNN models

Interactive visualization (optional with Streamlit/Gradio)
